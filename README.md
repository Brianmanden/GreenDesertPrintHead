# Welcome to Project: Green Desert Print Head
### by Rambling Minions Inc.

This is an attempt to develop a project that will be able to "print" with plants, fruit trees etc. through hostile environments such as deserts.

We will be researching  technical possibilities, consider and calculate costs to make it feasible to implement this project in "real life"... if not by us, The Rambling Minions Inc., then by anyone who would care to give it a try.

Contributions are most welcome, whether it be minor or mayor in concepts, research or anything else for that matter.

Above all this should be a fun project.

Feel free to join :)
